# Character Select

### A Mod for Super Mario 64 Coop Deluxe acting as an overall Model Selector! With an Extensive API and tons of Support!

 <img src="images/menu-preview.png"> <!--width=""-->
 
 Our main goal is to make Character Creation on Lua's end as simple as possible, and to move away from the old Skin Pack mod people keep copying and pasting. With this goal in mind, we tried to make everything as streamlined as possible throughout the character addition process, while allowing for tons of customizability!
