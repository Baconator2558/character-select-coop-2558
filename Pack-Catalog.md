It's payback time!

Well, this is my first mod for SM64, so there's definitely gonna be some jank! But hey, Travis is in the Mushroom Kingdom!

So, Travis has expressions, a voice, and a hud icon! But he has no palette support.
He also will use Luigi's moves if you're using the Character Moveset mod!
